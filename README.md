Problem vs Solution
Problems:
1. There is mistakes in the program, but don’t know why it’s wrong.
2. While braiding the collar, i might use the wrong string and get messed up.
3. The program doesn’t show errors, but the result shown isn’t what I expected.
4. When we code, our mind is in the perfect world thinking that it will all work as expected, but when we go back to the realistic world, there will be a lot of things happening not according to plan.

Solution:
1. Ask ChatGPT to tell you where’s wrong and how to correct it.
2. Be more concentrated and check before I move on to then next step.
3. Ask ChatGPT to write another program for me and try again.
4. Understand the realistic world and the noise around you to solve the problems and create an APP that can really help people.
